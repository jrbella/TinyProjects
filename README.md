# Project Details

-- This project is from a workbook "Tiny Python Projects" writting by Ken Youens-Clark.  The main repository is written here: https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects
-- This repository follows my interpretation of the workbook as well as additional code written by myself as I work through the 22 Projects
-- This repository does not cover Object Oriented specifics that is covered by a different repository
-- This project continues on after the 22 projects presented by "Tiny Python Projects" and serves as a playground for tiny non-OO utilty programs
